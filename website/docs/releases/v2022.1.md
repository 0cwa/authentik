## Breaking changes

This release mostly removes legacy fields and features that have been deprecated for several releases.

- LDAP Outposts:

  This release removes the `accountStatus` and `superuser` fields. Use the direct replacements `goauthentik.io/ldap/active` and `goauthentik.io/ldap/superuser`.

- Proxy Outposts:

  This release consolidates headers sent by authentik to have a common prefix.

  The following headers have been removed:

	- X-Auth-Username, use `X-authentik-username`
	- X-Auth-Groups, use `X-authentik-groups`
	- X-Forwarded-Email, use `X-authentik-email`
	- X-Forwarded-Preferred-Username, use `X-authentik-username`
	- X-Forwarded-User, use `X-authentik-uid`

- API:

  The deprecated /api/v2beta/ Endpoint is removed. Use `/api/v3/`.

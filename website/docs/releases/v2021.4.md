## Headline Changes

- Configurable Policy engine mode

    In the past, all objects, which could have policies attached to them, required *all* policies to pass to consider an action successful.
    You can now configure if *all* policies need to pass, or if *any* policy needs to pass.

    This can now be configured for the following objects:

    - Applications (access restrictions)
    - Sources
    - Flows
    - Flow-stage bindings

    For backwards compatibility, this is set to *all*, but new objects will default to *any*.

- Expiring Events

    Previously, events would stay in the database forever, and had to eventually be cleaned up manually. This version add expiry to events with a default
    timeout of 1 Year. This also applies to existing events, and their expiry will be set during the migration.

- New UI

    While the UI mostly looks the same, under the hood a lot has changed. The Web UI is now a Single-page application based on rollup and lit-html. This has several consequences and new features, for example:

    - You can now see a user's OAuth Access/Refresh tokens and the consents they've given
    - You can now see a per-object changelog based on the model_create/update/delete events being created.
    - A new API Browser is available under `https://authentink.company/api/v2beta/`
    - Several new charts, new pages and quality-of-life improvements
    - Credentials of objects are no longer shown while editing them

- Deprecated Group membership has been removed.

## Minor changes

- You can now specify the amount of processes started in docker-compose using the `WORKERS` environment variable.

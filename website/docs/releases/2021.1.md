title: Release 2021.1.1
---

## Headline Changes

- New versioning schema (year.month.release)
- Add global email settings

    In previous versions, you had to configure email connection details per [Email Stage](../flow/stages/email/index.md). Now, you can (and should) configure global settings.

    This is documented under the [docker-compose](../installation/docker-compose.md) and [Kubernetes](../installation/kubernetes.md) sections.

- New notification system

    More info can be found under [Notifications](../events/notifications.md) and [Transports](../events/transports.md).

    During the update, some default rules will be created. These rules notify you about policy exceptions, configuration errors and updates.

    These notifications will be sent using a default transport, which uses the global email transport.

## Fixes

- sources/*: Add source to flow context, so source is logged during login
- outposts: Fix outpost not correctly updating on outpost modification
- outposts: Improve drift detection on kubernetes
- providers/saml: Fix metadata not being signed when signature is enabled
- policies: Improve error handling, ensure original stacktrace is preserved

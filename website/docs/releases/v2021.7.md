## Headline Changes

- SSL Support for LDAP Providers

    You can now configure certificates for your LDAP Providers, meaning that all communication will be done encrypted.

    Currently, only SSL on port 636 is supported, not StartTLS.

- Add bundeled docs

    You can now browse the authentik docs for your version by browsing to `/help`. This means you don't have to rely on an
    internet connection to check the docs, and you also have the correct docs for your currently running version.

## Minor changes

- api: Tunnel Sentry requests through authentik to prevent them being blocked by ad-blockers
- core: fix error when setting icon/background to url longer than 100 chars
- events: fix error when slack notification request failed without a response
- flows: allow variable substitution in flow titles
- outposts/ldap: Fix LDAP outpost missing a `member` field on groups with all member DNs
- outposts/ldap: Fix LDAP outpost not parsing arrays from user and group attributes correctly
- providers/oauth2: allow blank redirect_uris to allow any redirect_uri
- providers/saml: fix parsing of POST bindings
- root: add PROXY protocol support for http, https, ldap and ldaps servers
- root: Allow configuration of Redis port
- root: set samesite to None for SAML POST flows
- root: subclass SessionMiddleware to set Secure and SameSite flag depending on context
- web: fix error when showing error message of request

# Providers

Providers allow external applications to authenticate against passbook and use its user information.

## OpenID Provider

This provider utilises the commonly used OpenID Connect variation of OAuth2.

## OAuth2 Provider

This provider is slightly different than the OpenID Provider. While it uses the same basic OAuth2 Protocol, it provides a GitHub-compatible endpoint. This allows you to integrate applications which don't support custom OpenID providers.
The API exposes username, email, name, and groups in a GitHub-compatible format.

## SAML Provider

This provider allows you to integrate enterprise software using the SAML2 Protocol. It supports signed requests and uses [Property Mappings](property-mappings/index.md#saml-property-mapping) to determine which fields are exposed and what values they return. This makes it possible to expose vendor-specific fields.
Default fields are exposed through auto-generated Property Mappings, which are prefixed with "Autogenerated".

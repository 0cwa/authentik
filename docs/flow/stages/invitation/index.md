# Invitation Stage

This stage can be used to invite users. You can use this enroll users with preset values.

If the option `Continue Flow without Invitation`, this stage will continue when no invitation token is present.

If you want to check if a user has used an invitation within a policy, you can check `request.context.invitation_in_effect`.
